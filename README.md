## :bulb: Motivation and Context
All clickable components defined in designs have a reserved part of the code that is invoked when
interacting with them. This facilitates the potential implementation of functionality that is not
required for the challenge.

All the texts that appear in the application are translatable, and the numbers are formatted 
according to the deviceâ€™s locale. Moreover, all screens support both portrait and landscape 
orientations and respect the system gestures.

Home screen has been implemented with the intention of displaying similarly regardless of the screen 
size. Additionally, in the Position list, the first column is designed to support longer numbers and 
ensure everything is properly aligned.
